# Colour-Palette-Analyzer
Import an image and see the top three colours that make it up!

## Usage

Run file with a path to the target image

## Motivation

- I am a huge fan of art and cinema and sometimes, I'd look at a shot from a movie, poster, album cover, etc. and wonder "What colours did they use to make this?"
- This program is the solution for that. It's a program I hope the curious or people like digital artists can use to see what exact colours a reference image used.

## Examples

- Scene from *Grand Budapest Hotel*:
